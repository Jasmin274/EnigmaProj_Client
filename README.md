# EnigmaProj_Client
I am writing an enigma project that includes socket multi-client connection and a simulator. This is the client repository.

The client uses tkinter as the GUI. The client implements different kinds of encryption - Enigma, Morse and RSA.
It also includes chat between all the connected users, therefore also operates with threads.
This is my first project with Cryptography yet not my first experience with it. I find this topic fascinating and 
I sincerely hope I will have more opportunities to practice with is.
